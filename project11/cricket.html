                <div>
                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre
                        of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
                        three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while 
                        the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of
                        dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding
                        side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have 
                        been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided 
                        by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers 
                        who record the match's statistical information.
                    </p>

                        There are various formats ranging from Twenty20,
                        played over a few hours with each team batting for a single 
                        innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs 
                        and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play 
                        in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the
                        basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard,
                        solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which
                        is layered with tightly wound string.
